		<h2>More About Me</h2>
		<h3>My Favorite Hobbies</h3>
		<p>
			I love dogs. My husband and I have two dogs -- Nala, a 5-year-old Goldendoodle, and Cuya, a 1-year-old Labradoodle. I love playing with them and taking photos of them. In fact, I run Instagram accounts for both of them: @nala_doodle and @a_labradoodles_life. I'm also passionate about child welfare, and am very involved with the King County CASA Program. 
		</p>
		<h3>My Dream Job</h3>
		<p>
			I'd love to run a doggy daycare. 
		</p>
		<h3>My Background</h3>
			I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. After college, I spent four years working in digital marketing at Redfin, where I was exposed to programming via HTML and CSS for email marketing and SQL for analytics. I'm hoping to begin a web development career soon.
